//! The connections behind the feature: a small pool of multiplexed ones per
//! DSN for ordinary commands, and dedicated ones for the commands that cannot
//! share a socket.
//!
//! Redis serves one connection strictly in order, so what a connection is used
//! for decides how it may be shared:
//!
//! - an ordinary command shares a multiplexed connection with every other task,
//!   which is where the feature's whole gain comes from — thirty GETs from
//!   thirty coroutines go out as one pipeline and come back in one round trip;
//! - a blocking command (BLPOP, XREAD BLOCK, WAIT) holds the server's attention
//!   for as long as it waits, so on a shared socket it would stall every command
//!   queued behind it. It gets a connection of its own for the call;
//! - a subscription owns its connection outright, because the protocol puts the
//!   connection itself into subscriber mode.
