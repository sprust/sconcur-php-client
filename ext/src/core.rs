//! Process-wide state, and what it takes to survive a `fork`.
//!
//! A runtime started inside `dlopen` would already have threads in the process
//! by the time PHP's `MINIT` runs — which is what makes `pcntl_fork` after
//! loading unsafe, and what rules FPM and mod_php out.
//! Nothing here starts until the first push, so a process that loads the
//! extension and forks without using it hands each child a clean slate.
//!
//! A fork *after* first use is the harder case and is handled explicitly: only
//! the forking thread survives into the child, so the inherited runtime is a
//! shell with no worker threads behind it. A `pthread_atfork` child handler
//! flags that, and the next access rebuilds everything.
//!
//! The old state is **leaked, never dropped**: dropping a `tokio::Runtime`
//! joins its worker threads, and in the child those threads do not exist — the
//! join would block forever. Leaking is correct here, not sloppy: the child's
//! copy-on-write image already holds those pages, and the process either
//! rebuilds and runs, or exits.
