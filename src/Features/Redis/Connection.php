/**
 * A Redis connection on top of the extension's Redis feature.
 *
 * The object owns no socket. Ordinary commands share a small pool of multiplexed
 * connections held in the extension and keyed by this dsn, so many coroutines issuing
 * commands at the same time send them down one socket as one pipeline and get their
 * answers back in one round trip. That is what this feature is for; a single command in
 * isolation is slower than phpredis, because it pays the boundary on top of the same work.
 *
 * Outside a WaitGroup every call here works synchronously.
 *
 * Values are bytes. Nothing is prefixed, serialized or compressed on the way through —
 * see docs/redis.md.
