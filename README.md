# SConcur

> ⚠️ Experimental project, not for production. Yet another attempt to make
> PHP asynchronous, but without a hand-written C extension — with one written in
> Rust.

A concurrency library for PHP on top of a custom Rust extension. The PHP side
(a Fiber) suspends while the extension runs the task (MongoDB operations, sleep,
and so on) concurrently on an async runtime. The two sides exchange data over
MessagePack.

## Numbers against RoadRunner and Swoole

The same demo application on the same machine: `wrk` 4 threads / 256 connections
/ 20 s, database data on disk. The worker count per server is given in the row:
the empty response was measured at 12, while `/db` and `/db-rw` come from the
worker-count ladder, at its 8-worker rung (where SConcur peaks and the load
generator does not yet share cores with the servers):

| Request | SConcur | RoadRunner | Swoole |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| empty response (12 workers) | ≈194 300 rps, p50 0.9 ms | ≈45 100 rps, p50 5.4 ms | ≈365 600 rps, p50 0.35 ms |
| point SELECT by id, `/db` (8 workers) | 44 200 rps, p50 5.4 ms | 22 887 rps, p50 10.7 ms | 117 693 rps, p50 2.0 ms |
| INSERT + COUNT(*) + SELECT, `/db-rw` (8 workers) | 2 366 rps, p50 95.8 ms | 289 rps, p50 877 ms | 2 467 rps, p50 89.8 ms |

Swoole is faster on the cheap paths, but its concurrency rests on hooks into the
existing PHP drivers: whatever the hooks do not cover blocks the whole worker (as
`ext-mongodb` does). In SConcur a feature is ordinary async Rust on top of a
mature Rust driver, which makes new features easier to add and to maintain.

Where SConcur does not win — single cheap queries, megabyte payloads, CPU-bound
handlers — is listed just as plainly in
["Is SConcur for you?"](docs/positioning.md#is-sconcur-for-you), next to the
[feature benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md) and the
[behaviour under load](docs/load-testing.md).

## Idea

Regular PHP is synchronous: `sleep()`, a PDO query, an HTTP call — each one
blocks the process, and they run strictly one after another. Two one-second
operations take two seconds.

SConcur runs such operations at the same time. You swap the blocking calls for
SConcur equivalents (see [What it replaces](#what-it-replaces)), wrap them in
coroutines, and the work moves into the extension and runs there in parallel. The
total time is bound by the slowest operation, not by their sum. PHP stays a thin
orchestration layer; all concurrency lives below it.

## Example

Two coroutines run at the same time, each a one-second operation. Sequentially
this would be about two seconds; concurrently it is about one.

```php
use SConcur\WaitGroup;
use SConcur\Features\Sleeper\Sleeper;

$start = microtime(true);

$waitGroup = WaitGroup::create();

// coroutine 1: a one-second operation (instead of the blocking sleep())
$waitGroup->add(function () {
    Sleeper::sleep(seconds: 1);

    return 1;
});

// coroutine 2: the same operation again
$waitGroup->add(function () {
    Sleeper::sleep(seconds: 1);

    return 2;
});

$waitGroup->waitResults();

$seconds = round(microtime(true) - $start, 2);

echo "done in {$seconds} s" . PHP_EOL;
```

Output: `done in 1 s` — two one-second operations ran in parallel.

## What it replaces

Operations and clients — wrapped in a coroutine (`$waitGroup->add()` +
`$waitGroup->wait*()`), they run concurrently instead of blocking the process:

| Native PHP | SConcur | What changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sleep()`, `usleep()` | `Sleeper::sleep()`, `Sleeper::usleep()` | pause for seconds or microseconds |
| `PDO` / `mysqli` (MySQL) | `Features\Mysql\Connection` | queries, transactions, SELECT streaming; a connection pool in the extension |
| `PDO` (PostgreSQL) | `Features\Pgsql\Connection` | the same SQL feature on the pgx driver |
| `mongodb/mongodb`, `ext-mongodb` | `Features\Mongodb\Connection\*` | CRUD, aggregation, cursors; BSON values are `SConcur\Bson\*` |
| `curl`, `file_get_contents`, Guzzle | `Features\HttpClient\HttpClient` (PSR-18) | response streaming, download straight to a file inside the extension |
| `fsockopen`, `stream_socket_client` | `Features\SocketClient\SocketClient` | TCP with length-prefix framing |
| a WS client library | `Features\WsClient\WsClient` | text/binary messages |
| `ext-amqp`, `php-amqplib` (RabbitMQ) | `Features\Amqp\*` | a consumer suspends its coroutine, not the worker; settling belongs to the delivery |
| `ext-redis` (phpredis), predis | `Features\Redis\Connection` | commands of many coroutines share one socket as a pipeline; pub/sub and cursors stream |

Long-lived servers:

| Native PHP | SConcur | What changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PHP-FPM, RoadRunner, Swoole, Workerman | `Features\HttpServer\HttpServer` (PSR-7) | HTTP server |
| `stream_socket_server` | `Features\SocketServer\SocketServer` | TCP server |
| Ratchet, Workerman (WS) | `Features\WsServer\WsServer` | WebSocket server |

## How it works

`WaitGroup` wraps each closure in a `Fiber`. When an async feature is called,
the coroutine suspends and the task goes to the extension, onto its own runtime
task. Every `WaitGroup` owns one flow — the group of tasks that belong to it on
the extension side.
A single process-wide `Scheduler` waits on the extension (`waitAnyBatch`): it
blocks until the first result of any flow is ready, picks up the results that
are already ready together with it in one crossing of the boundary, and resumes
the matching coroutines by `taskKey`. Results arrive in task-completion order,
not in `add()` order.

The number of concurrently live coroutines in a group is unlimited by default.
To bound memory or a DB connection pool, set a limit:
`WaitGroup::create(maxConcurrency: N)` — excess `add()` calls queue and start as
slots free up.

Details — the "PHP Fiber ↔ runtime task" diagrams, the layers and the task
lifecycle — in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Why an extension, and why Rust

The whole concurrency model reduces to one primitive: a channel. Every task runs
as its own task on the runtime, and the results of every flow land in one shared
bounded channel. PHP runs no event loop and polls nothing — the single
process-wide `Scheduler` blocks reading a message from that channel
(`waitAnyBatch`) and wakes on the first ready result, taking the results that
are already ready with it in the same crossing. Which task finished first is
decided by the channel; PHP only resumes the matching coroutine by `taskKey`.

Everything else follows from that:

- A feature is one async Rust function. You write the handler; the runtime runs
  it as a task and puts the result into the channel. No promises, no callbacks,
  no event-loop reasoning on the PHP side.
- Mature drivers are reused as-is — the MongoDB driver, sqlx, hyper, reqwest,
  lapin, fastwebsockets — and run concurrently right away. No waiting for async
  PHP drivers or extensions.
- The C glue is frozen: `push`, `wait`, `waitAny`/`waitAnyBatch`, `next`,
  `stopFlow` plus the `version`/`destroy` lifecycle. A new feature is data (a
  `MethodEnum` value, a MessagePack payload DTO, a Rust handler), not a new C
  symbol, so the export set never grows. A new long-lived server adds at most
  one control function, like `httpStopAccepting`, which stops accepting new
  connections while the ones in progress are finished.
- One transport and one streaming model for everything: MessagePack DTOs plus
  the streaming states behind `next()` — MongoDB cursors, HTTP bodies, socket
  frames, WS messages all travel the same mechanism, and the sender waits when
  the reader falls behind.
- One API for sync and async: no separate "async" and "sync" variants of the
  same function. The same call works inside a `WaitGroup` (concurrent) and
  outside it (an ordinary blocking call); concurrency is chosen by the caller,
  not by the feature author.
- A feature gets the runtime for free: nested coroutines, context cancellation,
  deadline propagation, graceful shutdown with unwinding.
- Client and server features expose PSR interfaces (PSR-7/17, PSR-18) with
  injected factories, so they drop into any application without adapters.

## Use and limitations

- A long-lived process is where the gain is real, and that is what the library
  is tested on: workers, daemons, console commands, and the HTTP, WebSocket and
  socket servers themselves, which are ordinary PHP scripts listening on a port
  (the Swoole / ReactPHP model). It also drops into a long-lived process you
  already run, including a RoadRunner worker. Nothing checks the SAPI.
- PHP-FPM is supported. Either style works inside a request: a plain
  synchronous call, or several operations at once through a `WaitGroup`. A pool
  of 4 static workers, each request running twelve 100 ms coroutines at the
  same time, answers in ~102 ms rather than 1200 (`ext/check/fpm-check.sh`) — a
  worker rebuilds the runtime after the master forks it. Connections are pooled
  inside the extension (one pool per DSN, per MongoDB URI, per set of AMQP
  credentials), shared by every coroutine of the process, so a request opens no
  connection of its own while the pool is alive. What FPM does not give is
  concurrency *between* requests: the request ends when its work does, and the
  pools go with it, because releasing the extension at request shutdown closes
  them.
- `pcntl_fork` is supported, including after the extension has run work. Only the
  forking thread survives into the child, so the runtime it inherits has no
  worker threads left; the extension notices and rebuilds it on the child's next
  call. The parent is unaffected.
- NTS (non-thread-safe) only. A ZTS PHP refuses to load the NTS `.so` outright,
  and rebuilding it for ZTS would not help: the extension holds its state per
  process on the assumption that one PHP thread issues every call, while the PHP
  side numbers flows with a class static that a ZTS build gives each thread a
  copy of — two request threads would collide on the same flow key.
- Linux only — core-count detection, signals/`posix`, `SO_REUSEPORT`, the
  master's `flock`.
- `exit()`/`die()` with active tasks is safe but loses their results. The
  shutdown handler unwinds unfinished coroutines (finally blocks run,
  transactions roll back, cursors and flows are released), then the process exits
  normally. Better to run tasks to completion or stop them explicitly
  (`WaitGroup::stop()`).
- Concurrent mode is optional. Any feature can be called outside a `WaitGroup` as
  an ordinary synchronous call: outside a Fiber `FeatureExecutor` detects the
  non-async context and simply waits for the result (`Extension::wait`).

```php
// synchronous, without WaitGroup — returns the result immediately
$collection->insertOne(['name' => 'example']);
```

## Build

The extension core is `ext/` (Rust). It builds into `ext/build/sconcur.so`:

```shell
make ext-build
```

## echo test
```shell
php -d extension=./ext/build/sconcur.so -r "echo \SConcur\Extension\ping('hello') . PHP_EOL;"
```
## Roadmap

- The `Std` feature — SConcur equivalents of standard PHP functions that block
  the worker or are CPU-bound non-preemptible monoliths (sleep, json, hash, gzip,
  password hashing, file I/O), executed in the extension; absorbs `Sleeper`.
- Auto-recovery of stuck workers — a master watchdog by heartbeat: `SIGKILL` and
  respawn a worker whose PHP thread has hung.
- Split the core and the features into separate packages.
- Stopping a single coroutine from anywhere, not just the whole flow. The other
  half of this — a deadline on one — is done, see
  [coroutine timeout](docs/coroutine-timeout.md).
- Optimize the synchronous path — a call outside a coroutine goes to the
  extension directly, bypassing the scheduler and the Fiber machinery.
- Explore a cross-process concurrency mode, so concurrent operations can use
  several processes (and cores) instead of the runtime tasks of one process.
